# .py_projects
A culmination of my personal python projects.

This repository will include all of my python projects. I am not a career programmer and many of my programs will likely not be optimized or set up for profesional use. This repository is listed under the unlicense, meaning that any programs in this are free to use in any way you want with or without modification. Listed below is a list of the programs that are in this repo with short descriptions of that program. I will do my best to keep this up to date with the files in the repo. Have fun, signed X.
